# latex-automater
Automating the creation of latex documents.

Lots can be done to make this better. Bash would probably not be a good idea long term. 

Update the config file for yourself. 

Usage is going to be something like this for me

```
bash ~/latex-automater/make-script.sh The Elephant and the Whale
```

Adding an alias so it will be actually something like

```
newlatex The Elephant and the 
```
